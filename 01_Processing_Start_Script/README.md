# Processing Start Script

Play around and have some fun!
Just copy/paste the code from `processing_start_script.pde` into a processing sketch or download the file.

### Some stuff to try out

* replace the x, y in rect() by mouseX, and mouseY
* try to uncomment (=deactivate) the background
* try to draw one more [primitive shape](https://processing.org/examples/shapeprimitives.html)
