# Part 2: Cellular Automata

We will use Wolfram's Cellular Automata to produce complex patterns based on a simple algorithm.

This script produces 256 possible patterns. A complete overview can be found [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).

But we will go a bit further to produce stuff like this

We don't have the time to cover the full code in the workshop. But if someone is interested in learning how to write such a code I can recommend you the following resources:
